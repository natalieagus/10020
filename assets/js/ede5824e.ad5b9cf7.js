The last two abstract methods that we have is simply the getter and the setter of ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"start_state")," computed property which has to be implemented for all ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"StateMachine")," child class. We created a general implementation that sets and returns the attribute ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"__start_state"),". We use Python name mangling with double underscore at the beginning of the variable to keep this attribute hidden."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"So now, what we need to do is simply to implement the two abstract methods, i.e. ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," and ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"legal_inputs"),", as well as initializing the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"start_state")," property. For example, we can initialize the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"start_state")," property and implement the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," property as follows:"),(0,s.kt)("pre",null,(0,s.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python"},'class MapSM(StateSpaceSearch):\n\n    def __init__(self, start):\n        self.start_state = start\n\n    @property\n    def statemap(self):\n        statemap = {"S": ["A", "B"],\n                    "A": ["S", "C", "D"],\n                    "B": ["S", "D", "E"],\n                    "C": ["A", "F"],\n                    "D": ["A", "B", "F", "H"],\n                    "E": ["B", "H"],\n                    "F": ["C", "D", "G"],\n                    "H": ["D", "E", "G"],\n                    "G": ["F", "H"]}\n        return statemap\n')),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Notice that the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," must be defined in the child class that implements ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"StateSpaceSearch")," because such mapping transition information can be different from one state machine to another. This cannot be defined in the base class."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Similarly, the computed property ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"legal_inputs")," can take in the information from ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," and return a set of the legal inputs. Though we may think that the code to create such a set is the same for all state-space search, it actually depends on how one implements the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," property. If one uses a list as in our case, such set will be a set of integer values. But if one uses a dictionary, the set ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"legal_inputs")," may be a set of other data types used in the key of that dictionary."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"In this state machine the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"start_state")," is the starting state of our search problem. For example, state 'S' should be initialized as our ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"start_state")," following the previous examples."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"We also need to define our ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"get_next_values(state, inp)")," method. This method should return the next state and the output of our search transition. In our state-space search, the output is usually the same as the next state, which is what state should the machine go to given the current state and the input action. In fact, this function is exactly what a successor function ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap_successor(state, action)")," does in our previous discussion. This means that you can implement your ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"get_next_values(state, inp)")," method using the information you have from ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"statemap")," and ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"legal_inputs"),". Remember to ensure that if the input is not valid for that current state, it should remain in the current state. And now you have a complete state machine to do state-space search."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"You can write your breadth-first search algorithm and makes use of the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"get_next_values()")," of the state machine to find a path from the starting state to the goal state.
