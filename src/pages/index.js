                description="The best way to get better at computing is by exposing yourself to more algorithms and data structures and actually implementing them. One of the common computation is to sort some items in some way.  For example, sorting a number from smallest to biggest or names alphabetically. In this article, we will describe some sorting algorithms which you can implement in Python. Moreover, you will learn various data structures that can make such computation faster. We will talk about what it means to be fast. We will also introduce you on how to work with non linear data such as trees and graphs."

In fact, the whole software can be thought of as an object and an object can be composed of other objects. We will introduce on what object is and how we can create object that is made of other objects. We will use Object-Oriented paradigm to implement some data structures. Using the power of inheritance, we will offer the best practice in coding by reusing and extending code."

Instead of relying on explicit instructions, machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from examples and adapt their behavior accordingly."
